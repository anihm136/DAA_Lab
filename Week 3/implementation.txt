  5.maxIndex
  6.swapWithMax
  7.selectionSort
  8.numSwaps

1. isSorted verifies if a given array is sorted, by linearly traversing through the array. It returns 0 if it encounters an element whose next element is smaller than it, and returns 1 if it traverses the entire array without such an instance.

2. bubblePass performs one pass of the bubbleSort algorithm, swapping an element with its next neighbor if it is greater than the neighbor.

3. bubbleSort performs at most n passes of bubblePass, checking if the array is sorted after every pass.

4. numPasses performs bubbleSort, and maintains a counter on the number of bubblePasses performed, which is returned in the end.

5. maxIndex returns the index of the max element, by maintaining the current max and maxindex in a variable and checking for higher elements linearly.

6. swapWithMax swaps the max element with the last element of the array.

7. selectionSort performs at most n passes of swapWithMax, checking every pass if the array is sorted.

8. numSwaps keeps a counter to count the number of swaps performed during selectionSort, and returns it in the end.
